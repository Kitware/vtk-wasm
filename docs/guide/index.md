# VTK.wasm

The guide section of this website aim to cover the various usage of VTK.wasm depending on your background and needs. 

We __will__ have a section covering all the details on how one can build its own VTK application in pure C++ and make it available to the web using WASM. Such path require a solid understanding of VTK and C++ with some CMake.

We also have a section more focused on pure JavaScript developer covering how they can use our pre-built WASM bundle for creating 3D scene directly from JavaScript.

Finally, if you are looking for the rendering capabilities of WASM and C++ or JavaScript are not for you, we have a section on trame which focus on how you can take benefit of it in plain Python.

The available guides won't cover VTK in general and will only use "simple VTK code" to demonstrate the usage of VTK in the WASM context that is relevant to you. For pure VTK questions, you should refer to the [examples website](https://examples.vtk.org/site/), [VTK API](https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/index.html) or the main [VTK website](https://vtk.org/).
